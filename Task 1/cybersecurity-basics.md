# Cybersecurity Basics

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. It focuses on ensuring secure information handling and system reliability.

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity principles.

### 1. Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users.
It prevents unauthorized disclosure of data.

**Techniques used:**
- Encryption (AES, RSA)
- Authentication (Passwords, Biometrics)
- Access Control (Role-Based Access Control)

**Example:**
Online banking websites use HTTPS to keep login credentials confidential.

---

### 2. Integrity
Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and not altered without authorization.

**Techniques used:**
- Hashing (MD5, SHA256)
- Digital Signatures
- Checksums

**Example:**
Hash values are used to verify that downloaded software has not been tampered with.

---

### 3. Availability
Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.

**Techniques used:**
- Backups
- Load Balancing
- Redundancy
- DDoS protection

**Example:**
Cloud services use multiple servers so websites remain accessible even if one server fails.

---

## Threat Types

### 1. Phishing
Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information using fake emails or websites.

**Example:** Fake bank email asking for login credentials.

---

### 2. Malware
Malware is malicious software designed to damage or disrupt systems.

**Types:**
- Virus
- Worm
- Trojan
- Spyware

---

### 3. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
Attackers flood a target system with massive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

---

### 4. SQL Injection
An attack where malicious SQL queries are injected into input fields to manipulate databases.

---

### 5. Brute Force Attack
An attacker tries multiple password combinations until the correct one is found.

---

### 6. Ransomware
Malware that encrypts victim data and demands ransom for decryption.

---

## Attack Vectors

### 1. Social Engineering
Manipulating human psychology to gain unauthorized access.

**Example:** Pretending to be IT support.

---

### 2. Wireless Attacks
Attacks on Wi-Fi networks such as:
- Evil Twin
- Deauthentication attacks

---

### 3. Insider Threats
Security threats caused by trusted internal users such as employees or contractors.
