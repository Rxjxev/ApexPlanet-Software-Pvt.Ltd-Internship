# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a security assessment technique used to identify
weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It analyzes running services,
software versions, and configurations by comparing them against known
vulnerability databases.

This process helps organizations detect security risks early and reduce the
chances of exploitation.

---

## Why Vulnerability Scanning Is Important

- Identifies outdated and vulnerable software  
- Detects insecure or misconfigured services  
- Evaluates the overall security posture of a system  
- Helps prioritize risks based on severity  

---

## Tools Used

- **Nmap** – Port scanning and service enumeration  
- **Nmap NSE Scripts** – Detection of known vulnerabilities  
- **OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)** – Comprehensive vulnerability assessment  

Each tool offers different levels of depth, accuracy, and reporting capabilities.

## Target Information

- **Target Machine**: Metasploitable  
- **IP Address**: 172.23.164.238  
- **Environment**: Local virtual lab (VMware)  
- **Operating System**: Linux 2.6.x (Detected via Nmap)  

---

## Nmap Port Scanning

```bash
nmap 172.23.164.238
```

This scan identifies open TCP ports and exposed network services.

---

## Observed Open Ports

- FTP (21)  
- SSH (22)  
- Telnet (23)  
- SMTP (25)  
- DNS (53)  
- HTTP (80)  
- RPCBind (111)  
- NetBIOS / SMB (139, 445)  
- MySQL (3306)  
- PostgreSQL (5432)  
- VNC (5900)  
- IRC (6667)  
- AJP13 (8009)  

> ⚠️ A large number of open services indicates a highly exposed attack surface,
which is common in intentionally vulnerable systems like Metasploitable.

---

## Service & Version Detection

```bash
nmap -sV -O 172.23.164.238
```

This scan reveals service versions and operating system details.

---

## Identified Services

- **vsftpd 2.3.4** (FTP)  
- **OpenSSH 4.7p1**  
- **Telnet** (unencrypted access)  
- **Apache 2.2.8** (HTTP)  
- **Samba 3.x** (SMB)  
- **MySQL 5.0.51a**  
- **PostgreSQL 8.3.x**  
- **VNC Protocol 3.3**  

> ⚠️ Many of these services are outdated and known to contain publicly
available exploits.

---

## Known Vulnerable Services

- vsftpd 2.3.4 – Backdoor vulnerability  
- Telnet – Cleartext authentication  
- Samba 3.x – Remote code execution vulnerabilities  
- Apache 2.2.8 – Legacy server with known CVEs  
- MySQL 5.0.x – Weak authentication mechanisms  
- VNC – Weak or missing authentication  

---

## OpenVAS Vulnerability Scan

OpenVAS was used to perform a full vulnerability assessment of the target
system.

### Scan Configuration

- Scan Name: Metasploitable Discovery Scan  
- Scan Type: Full and Fast  
- Target: Metasploitable Machine  
- Scanner: OpenVAS Default  
- Quality of Detection (QoD): Enabled  
- Alive Test: Enabled  

---

## Severity Levels

- **Critical** – Immediate exploitation possible  
- **High** – Serious vulnerabilities requiring urgent attention  
- **Medium** – Moderate security weaknesses  
- **Low** – Informational findings  

---

## Findings

- Multiple critical and high-severity vulnerabilities detected  
- Insecure services running with default configurations  
- Weak authentication mechanisms present  
- Legacy software exposed to the network  

> ⚠️ A system with these weaknesses would be compromised quickly in a real-world
environment.

---

## Recommendations

- Disable unnecessary services  
- Replace Telnet with secure SSH configurations  
- Upgrade outdated software and services  
- Apply firewall and network segmentation rules  
- Perform regular vulnerability assessments  

---

## Conclusion

Vulnerability scanning converts raw scan data into actionable security insights.
The Metasploitable system demonstrates how outdated software and poor
configurations significantly increase attack risk.

Regular vulnerability scanning using tools like **Nmap** and **OpenVAS** is
essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
