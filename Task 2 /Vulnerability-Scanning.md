# Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning identifies known weaknesses in systems by comparing
services and configurations against vulnerability databases.

## Theory: Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is a proactive security technique used to detect
security flaws in operating systems, services, and network configurations.
It helps organizations understand their security posture before attackers
can exploit these weaknesses.

Unlike penetration testing, vulnerability scanning does not actively exploit
the system. Instead, it analyzes exposed services and maps them to known
vulnerabilities such as CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

## Tools Used
- Nmap NSE vulnerability scripts
- OpenVAS (Greenbone)
- Nessus Essentials

Each tool serves a specific purpose:
- **Nmap** is used for identifying open ports, services, and basic vulnerabilities.
- **OpenVAS** provides a detailed vulnerability assessment with severity levels.
- **Nessus** is commonly used in enterprise environments for compliance scanning.

## Nmap Vulnerability Scan (Practical)

Nmap was used to scan the Metasploitable target machine to identify exposed
ports and potentially vulnerable services.

### Command Executed
```bash
nmap -p- 172.23.164.238
Observation

The target system responded successfully, confirming it was active.

A large number of TCP ports were found open, including:

FTP (21)

SSH (22)

Telnet (23)

SMTP (25)

DNS (53)

HTTP (80)

SMB (139, 445)

MySQL (3306)

PostgreSQL (5432)

VNC (5900)

Learning

The presence of many open ports significantly increases the attack surface
of the system. Each exposed service must be assessed for known vulnerabilities.

Service Version & OS Detection

Service version detection was performed to identify outdated and vulnerable
software running on the target system.

Command Executed
nmap -sV -O 172.23.164.238

Observation

Several outdated services were detected:

vsftpd 2.3.4

Apache HTTP Server 2.2.8

MySQL 5.0.51a

PostgreSQL 8.3.x

The operating system was identified as Linux (kernel 2.6.x).

The system was confirmed to be Metasploitable, an intentionally vulnerable VM.

Learning

Identifying service versions allows security professionals to map services
to known CVEs and prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.

Nmap NSE Vulnerability Scripts

Nmap can also use vulnerability scripts to detect known issues.

nmap --script vuln -p 80,443 192.168.1.50

Example Findings

CVE identifiers

Affected services

Risk descriptions

SSL/TLS Vulnerability Scan

SSL/TLS configuration was analyzed to identify weak encryption settings.

nmap -p 443 --script ssl-enum-ciphers 192.168.1.50


This scan helps identify weak ciphers and outdated encryption protocols.

OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanning (Practical)

OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager) was used to perform a detailed
vulnerability assessment.

Steps Performed

Created a new scan task named Metasploitable Discovery Scan.

Selected the Metasploitable machine as the scan target.

Configured scan settings with default discovery options.

Executed the scan and monitored its progress.

Generated a vulnerability report after scan completion.

OpenVAS Findings

The vulnerability scan revealed multiple security issues, including:

Outdated and insecure services

Weak network configurations

Services running without access restrictions

Severity Levels

Critical – Immediate exploitation risk

High – Serious vulnerabilities requiring urgent attention

Medium – Moderate risk vulnerabilities

Low – Informational or minor issues

Severity classification helps prioritize remediation efforts.

Findings

Vulnerability scanning converts raw scan data into actionable security insights.
It enables security teams to identify high-risk vulnerabilities, prioritize fixes,
and improve the overall security posture of systems.

Regular vulnerability scanning is a fundamental practice in cybersecurity
and defensive security operations.
