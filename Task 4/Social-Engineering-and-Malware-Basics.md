##  Social Engineering (Simulation Only)

###  Theory

**Social Engineering** is an attack technique that manipulates human psychology rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities. Attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details by appearing trustworthy or authoritative.

Social engineering attacks are highly effective because they target human behavior, which is often the weakest link in security.

**Important:**  
Only **simulated social engineering attacks** are performed in this task for educational and awareness purposes. No real users are targeted.

### Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks
- Phishing
- Spear Phishing
- Pretexting
- Baiting
- Impersonation

---

###  Phishing Simulation using SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)

The **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** is a penetration testing framework designed specifically for social engineering attacks.

```bash
setoolkit
```

####  Simulation Steps
1. Launch SET using the command above  
2. Select **Social-Engineering Attacks**
3. Choose **Website Attack Vectors**
4. Select **Credential Harvester Attack Method**
5. Clone a legitimate login page
6. Demonstrate how credentials can be captured
7. Explain detection and prevention techniques

---

###  Security Awareness Outcome
- Demonstrates how phishing attacks work
- Highlights the importance of user awareness
- Encourages verification of links and URLs
- Reinforces the need for multi-factor authentication (MFA)

##  Malware Basics

###  Theory

**Malware** (Malicious Software) refers to any program designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems. Malware analysis helps security professionals understand how malicious software behaves, spreads, and communicates.

Understanding malware behavior is crucial for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies.

###  Types of Malware
- Viruses
- Worms
- Trojans
- Ransomware
- Spyware
- Rootkits

##  Malware Analysis Techniques

Malware analysis is broadly divided into two categories:

### 1️⃣ Static Analysis
Static analysis involves examining a malware sample **without executing it**. This method is safe and helps gather initial information about the file.

#### 🔹 Static Analysis Commands

```bash
file sample.exe
```

Identifies the file type and architecture.

```bash
strings sample.exe
```

Extracts readable strings that may contain:
- URLs
- IP addresses
- Commands

```bash
sha256sum sample.exe
```

Generates a cryptographic hash used to:
- Identify malware samples
- Check file integrity
- Compare against threat intelligence databases

---

### 2️⃣ Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox)

Dynamic analysis involves executing malware in a **controlled sandbox environment** to observe its real-time behavior.

#### 🔹 Tools Used
- Any.Run
- Cuckoo Sandbox

#### 🔹 Observed Behaviors
- File execution patterns
- Network communication
- Process creation
- File system changes
- Registry modifications

---

###  Security Importance

Malware analysis helps:
- Detect malicious behavior early
- Improve intrusion detection systems
- Strengthen endpoint security
- Prevent future attacks
