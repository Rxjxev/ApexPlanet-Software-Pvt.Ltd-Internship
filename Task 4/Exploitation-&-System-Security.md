#  Exploitation & System Security

##  Definition

**Exploitation & System Security** is a critical domain of cybersecurity that focuses on identifying, exploiting, analyzing, and securing vulnerabilities present in computer systems, networks, and applications.

**Exploitation** refers to the process of taking advantage of security weaknesses such as misconfigurations, unpatched software, weak authentication mechanisms, or vulnerable services to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or extract sensitive information. These activities are performed ethically and legally within authorized environments such as penetration testing labs or security assessments.

**System Security** involves protecting systems against potential attacks by implementing defensive measures such as patch management, firewall configuration, access control, service hardening, malware protection, and continuous monitoring. The goal is to reduce the attack surface and prevent successful exploitation.

###  In simple terms:
- **Exploitation** demonstrates *how systems can be attacked*
- **System Security** focuses on *how systems can be protected and hardened*

Together, **Exploitation & System Security** help security professionals understand attacker techniques and apply effective defensive strategies to build secure, resilient, and trustworthy systems.

##  Objective

The objective of Task 4 is to understand the **penetration testing lifecycle** and gain hands-on experience in exploiting vulnerabilities within a **controlled lab environment**. This task focuses on exploitation techniques, post-exploitation activities, password attacks, social engineering simulations, malware fundamentals, and system hardening practices while maintaining ethical and responsible security standards.

##  Penetration Testing Methodology

Penetration testing follows a structured and systematic approach to identify, exploit, and report security weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications.

###  Phases of Penetration Testing

### 1️⃣ Reconnaissance
- Information gathering about the target system
- Understanding network structure and exposed services

**Types:**
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: OSINT, WHOIS, DNS records
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Ping sweeps, banner grabbing

---

### 2️⃣ Scanning
- Identifying open ports, running services, and vulnerabilities

**Common Tools:**
- `nmap`
- Nessus
- OpenVAS

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O 192.168.56.102
```

---

### 3️⃣ Exploitation
- Using identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access
- Exploits can be automated or manual

**Tools:**
- Metasploit Framework
- Custom scripts

---

### 4️⃣ Post-Exploitation
- Maintaining access
- Privilege escalation
- Credential harvesting
- Internal reconnaissance

---

### 5️⃣ Reporting
- Documenting vulnerabilities
- Risk severity and impact
- Mitigation and remediation steps
